Every Mandalorian was combat trained and they could band together into an army on short notice.</p>\n<p>History. In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. The leader of the Mandalorians was known as the Mand'alor, translating to \"Sole Ruler\" and was rendered as \"Mandalore\" in Basic. Throughout their history, the Mandalorians were frequently allied with the Sith, perhaps most notably the Sith Lord Exar Kun, and held a certain distrust and general dislike for the Jedi Order. However, they would not hesitate to cooperate with the Jedi if a partnership between the two groups was mutually beneficial.

However, one of the armor's most lasting features was the T-shaped visor that adorned the helmet's face across its various incarnations. While sets of armor were often passed down from one generation to the next, beskar armor was considered the most valuable. The appearance of a Mandalorian's armor was largely up to the individual, being customized with different colored paint schemes, clan and unit sigils, personalized glyphs, or other marking patterns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"-the-mandoade-adding-beskar-armor\">Adding beskar armor</h5>\n<p>To add the effects of Beskar'gam to any mandalorian, add the Absorptive 1-3 armor property to any statblock.<br />Absorptive 1-3: When a creature takes damage from weapons, it is reduced by an amount equal to the absorptive number.

Many Mandalorian warriors were part of Mandalorian organizations such as Death Watch, Mandalorian Protectors, Nite Owls, and the Children of the Watch, where they served as saboteurs, assassins, infantry, and bounty hunters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-the-death-watch\">THE DEATH WATCH</h2>\n<p>The Death Watch was a Mandalorian terrorist splinter group of warriors that opposed the pacifist government of Mandalore. Following the end of the Mandalorian Civil War, the remaining Mandalorian martial traditionalists, who believed in the old warrior ways of Mandalore, were exiled to the moon of Concordia, where most of them were thought by the pacifistic New Mandalorians to have died out.</p>\n<section>\n<p>However, the survivors eventually regrouped and began calling themselves the Death Watch. Whereas the Old Mandalorians did not seek vengeance on the New Mandalorians, the Death Watch intended to overthrow the pacifist government and restore the traditional warrior ways of their people. They were then led in secret by Concordia's governor, Pre Vizsla of Clan Vizsla, who wielded the Darksaber, and Duchess Satine Kryze's sister, Bo-Katan Kryze.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"-mandalorian-explosives-artiste-sabine-wren\">SABINE WREN</h3>\n<p>Though she was first and foremost a free-spirited artist, Wren had been trained as a Mandalorian<br />warrior from an early age, and had extensive<br />expertise and knowledge in weaponry, as<br />well as proficiency in numerous combat skills.<br />A prodigy of sorts, accomplished and acrobatic<br />warrior and saboteur, both Hera Syndulla and<br />Kanan Jarrus had the greatest respect for Wren's skills and trusted her expertise on the inner workings of the Imperial military, a remnant of her past as a cadet at the Imperial Academy on Mandalore. As munitions specialist of the Ghost crew, she maintained and tuned all weapons but her crewmates' lightsabers, but also created many of the explosive devices she and the team used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-mandalor\">MAND'ALOR</h3>\n<p>Mand'alor, rendered as Mandalore in Galactic Basic, was the title assumed by the sole leader of the Mandalorian people. Their Protectors established a balance of control in the Mandalorians' warrior clan society. At some point prior to the Clone Wars, a Mand'alor known as Mandalore The Great waged a series of conflicts against the Jedi Order. The Mandalorian Jedi, Tarre Vizsla, once ruled all of Mandalore, and a descendant, Pre Vizsla, leader of the Mandalorian splinter group Death Watch, took the title of Mand'alor during his takeover of Mandalore, the Mandalorian homeworld, but the title became vacant when Vizsla was killed in a duel with Maul.</p>\n<p>During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the former Mandalorian super commando Gar Saxon, had wished to be Mand'alor and rule over the Mandalorians. The leader of the Protectors, Fenn Rau, claimed Saxon had no honor, thus Saxon was unable to claim the title. He was, however, installed as Viceroy of Mandalore by Emperor Palpatine. After Gar Saxon's death, his brother, Governor Tiber Saxon, succeeded him and wished to gain control of all of Mandalore, but was killed before he could achieve his goal after Sabine Wren returned to Mandalore with her clan and the Darksaber to free her father.</p>\n<p>After Saxon's death, Sabine Wren passed down the Darksaber to Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, who accepted the Darksaber from Wren and with the support of clans Wren, Vizsla, Rook, Eldar, her own Clan Kryze, and the Protectors, represented by Rau, stepped into the role of Mand'alor to unite the Mandalorian people against the Empire.</p>\n<section id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;display:contents\">\n<h3 id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors\">PROMINENT MAND'ALORS</h3>\n<section id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-tarre-vizsla\">\n<h4 id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-tarre-vizsla\">TARRE VIZSLA</h4>\n<p>Tarre Vizsla was the first Mandalorian accepted into the Jedi Order of the Old Republic.

After his passing, Vizsla was honored with a statue of himself on Mandalore. His darksaber was kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. However, it was stolen by members of House Vizsla. It was used by members of the House and Clan Vizsla to unify the people and strike down their enemies.</p>\n<p>The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, prior to 1019 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-pre-vizsla\">\n<h4 id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-pre-vizsla\">PRE VIZSLA</h4>\n<p>Pre Vizsla was the leader of the terrorist Mandalorian faction known as Death Watch.

In the Sundari's Royal Palace's throne room, Maul challenged Vizsla for leadership, which Vizsla accepted and handled Maul his lightsaber. At first, Vizsla had the upper hand in his duel with Maul by using his jetpack and blasters. However, Maul was able to defeat Vizsla. Vizsla, accepting his defeat, gave Maul the darksaber and was beheaded in front of the Death Watch.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-bo-katan-kryze\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;display:contents\">\n<h4 id=\"-mandalorian-supercommando-prominent-mandalors-bo-katan-kryze\">BO-KATAN KRYZE</h4>\n<p>During the subsequent civil war and the siege, Kryze was named Lady of House Kryze and Regent of Mandalore by the Jedi. However, the Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, and Kryze was forced out of power by Clan Saxon. However, in 2 BBY, Kryze chose to ally her House with Clan Wren when they chose to resist the Empire. However, when Sabine Wren gave her the Darksaber, Kryze refused due to her failing as Regent. With Clan Wren, she was able to free Sabine's father Alrich Wren. Unfortunately, Kryze learned that the Empire, under Governor Tiber Saxon, had rebuilt the Arc Pulse Generator (a weapon designed to attack mandalorian beskar) that Sabine had designed and codenamed the Duchess after Kryze's sister. Despite wanting to punish Wren for creating the Weapon, Kryze knew that they needed her help to destroy it. Thus, Kryze, Sabine, and their allies boarded Saxon's Star Destroyer.

{"name":"The Mandalorian Crusaders","content":"<h2 id=\"to-do-list-the-mandalorian-crusaders\">THE MANDALORIAN CRUSADERS</h2>\n<p>The Mandalorian Crusaders were the first documented type of Mandalorians, established by Mandalore the First, sometime after 24,000 BBY and under the command of Mandalore the Conqueror, later Mandalore the Indomitable, they eventually became involved in the Great Sith War and fought for the Jedi Knight-turned-Dark Lord of the Sith Ulic Qel-Droma. The Crusaders were traditional Mandalorian warriors, placing highest value on gaining honor and glory in combat.</p>\n<p>According to legend, the Crusaders were first formed on the planet Mandalore around the year 24,000 BBY by Mandalore the First, who is said to have conquered the world by defeating the Mythosaur, the great beasts who dominated the planet. After conquering Mandalore, the Mandalorians ventured on crusades in the years leading up to the Great Sith War, gaining them valuable planets such as Ordo, Concord Dawn, Shogun and Gargon.</p>\n<section id=\"to-do-list-the-mandalorian-crusaders-history\">\n<h3 id=\"to-do-list-the-mandalorian-crusaders-history\">HISTORY</h3>\n<p>The Mandalorians began as the humanoid Taung species from the planet Coruscant. Intense fighting with the thirteen Human nations of Coruscant known as the Battalions of Zhell began millennia before the Republic, and when a powerful volcano nearly wiped out the humans and darkened the skies over Coruscant, the Taung came to call themselves the Dha Werda Verda—the \"Warriors of the Shadow\". Despite the volcano's devastating effect, the Taung were eventually driven off Coruscant and took refuge on the world of Roon. Led by the warlord known as Mandalore the First, they would conquer another planet in the Outer Rim in 7000 BBY, which they named Mandalore after their leader. The Taung took on the name Mandalorians and were seen by many as the most skilled fighters in the galaxy, thriving in battle. These Mandalorian Crusaders were known for their use of cutting-edge weaponry and held to a strict code of honor, and wore armor known simply as \"Crusader Armor\" that differed from one soldier to the next.</p>\n<p>In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. The leader of the Mandalorians was known as the Mand'alor, translating to \"Sole Ruler\" and was rendered as \"Mandalore\" in Basic. Throughout their history, the Mandalorians were frequently allied with the Sith, perhaps most notably the Sith Lord Exar Kun, and held a certain distrust and general dislike for the Jedi Order. However, they would not hesitate to cooperate with the Jedi if a partnership between the two groups was mutually beneficial. In later years, the Mandalorians moved away from their obsessively war-like and conqueror ways and instead, most became bounty hunters and mercenaries, selling their skills to various individuals and factions in the galaxy.</p>\n<p>In the decades since their defeat in the Great Sith War, many Mandalorians had become convinced that their once-prophesied \"Great Last Battle\" was soon to be at hand. Emboldened by an element of the \"True Sith\" in hiding, Mandalore the Ultimate launched a campaign into the Outer Rim, on the edge of Republic space. Conquering several independent planets outside of the Republic's interests, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders were able to amass a clan territory larger than that ruled by the Hutts in the short span of a decade.</p>\n<p>As the Republic refused to get involved in the Mandalorians' conquests, wary of being dragged into another war so soon after the last, the Mandalorians plundered resources from conquered worlds and stockpiled them in order to fuel the growing campaign. With each victory in this ongoing series of proxy wars and border skirmishes, the Mandalorian clans grew more powerful, conscripting conquered species into their ranks as they probed the Republic's military strength and resolve. Just as it appeared as though the Neo-Crusaders' appetite for conquest had been satisfied, with the Mandalorians having failed to conquer a populated system in over a year by 3964 BBY, the Mandalorians struck out in force against the Republic. Striking swiftly from their outpost on Dxun, Onderon quickly fell to the Mandalorians,[ and it wasn't long before the likes of Vanquo and Taris soon joined it.</p>\n<p>The Mandalorians seemed on the verge of victory, with the Republic outmatched and overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of the Mandalorian tactics. Finally, when the Jedi Revanchists unveiled the true events of the Cathar genocide in a tragic vision, hundreds of Jedi followed the Knights Revan and Malak into the war against the Mandalorians, no longer able to stand back and watch without action. Revan proved to be an extremely capable commander in the field, masterminding a string of military victories, and rose swiftly through the ranks of the Republic Military; with his new-found authority to spearhead the Republic war effort, Revan spurred the all-but-defeated Republic Navy to push the Mandalorians back.</p>\n<p>In relatively short order, the Mandalorians were forced off of Taris, driven from Dxun—even Cassus Fett's victory at Jaga's Cluster could do little to halt the Republic's growing momentum. The year 3960 BBY would usher in the ultimate battle of the Mandalorian Wars, as Revan forced a confrontation with the Mandalorians in orbit over Malachor V. Drawing upon the dark side energies of Malachor, Revan faced off against Mandalore the Ultimate in single combat, slaying the Mand'alor. The experimental superweapon known as the Mass Shadow Generator was activated by one of Revan's Jedi Generals, destroying the Mandalorian fleet, but at the cost of a significant amount of the Republic fleet as well. With their fleet in ruins and their leader dead, the Mandalorians transmitted their unconditional surrender.</p>\n</section>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"l4V5sWdK1q3eXkPg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aGz4HfCmXQx6oTgK"}},"_id":"KfT6K8oifpx61oBr"}

These six tenets defined what it meant to be a Mandalorian, and any who wished to be considered as such was expected to abide by them. The Resol'nare consisted of wearing armor, speaking the Mandalorian language, defending oneself along with one's family, contributing to the welfare of your clan, rallying to the Mand'alor when summoned, and raising one's children in the Mandalorian ways. In order to retain their heritage in the face of outside influence, Mandalorians placed a high value on rigorously carrying out the Resol'nare's tenets in a daily manner.</p>\n<p>Many Mandalorian soldiers would become bounty hunters and mercenaries, selling their services to the highest bidder, many in the galaxy saw the Mandalorians as little else. While mercenary work and bounty hunting would be a primary means of income for the them, several Mandalorians earned their living as weaponsmiths, or bodyguards. Others toiled in workshops and factories, working the land as farmers, or as doctors. Despite the wide array of professions they took, every Mandalorian was combat trained and they could band together into an army on short notice. They were also considerably more sociable than many would expect. As long as individuals spoke their mind and said what they meant, looked them straight in the eye, paid their debts, never made a pass at a Mandalorian of the opposite sex unless they planned to become part of the culture, and respected the elderly—any Mandalorian who has reached such an age would be a renowned warrior—anyone who encountered a Mandalorian outside of combat was unlikely to come to harm.</p>\n<section>\n<section id=\"-the-mandalorians-armor\">\n<h3 id=\"-the-mandalorians-armor\">ARMOR</h3>\n<p>The most recognizable symbol of the Mandalorian culture, Mandalorian armor was a catch-all term for the sets of distinctive full-body armor worn by Mandalorian warriors and soldiers throughout galactic history. Known as beskar'gam in the Mandalorian language of Mando'a—a name which meant \"iron skin\" when translated into Basic—Mandalorian armor was central to the Mandalorian way of life. The wearing of armor was one of the Resol'nare, the six tenets that defined the Mandalorian culture. In an expansive community comprised of beings from numerous origins, the easily identifiable armor not only provided protection for the wearer, but a common visual identity for any and all Mandalorians, regardless of species or gender.</p>\n<p>The specific design of Mandalorian armor evolved over time, gaining more sophisticated features over the years, including the incorporation of advanced helmet heads-up displays, and armor-mounted weapon systems such as flamethrowers and wrist rocket launchers. However, one of the armor's most lasting features was the T-shaped visor that adorned the helmet's face across its various incarnations. Numerous materials were employed in the creation of Mandalorian armor through the millennia, from alum and durasteel, to stygian-triprismatic polymer and the nearly indestructible beskar iron. Mandalorian armor forged from beskar was highly prized for its incredible resilience, and while sets of armor were often passed down from one generation to the next, beskar armor was considered the most valuable. The appearance of a Mandalorian's armor was largely up to the individual, as the highly independent Mandalorian people customized their armor with different colored paint schemes, clan and unit sigils, personalized glyphs, or other marking patterns in accordance to their own tastes.</p>\n<div id=\"p4\">\n<blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"-mandalorians\">MANDALORIANS</h2>\n<p>Tier 17, lawful balanced</p>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"width:36.8966%;height:34px\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<th style=\"width:17.0088%;height:17px\">STR</th>\n<th style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">DEX</th>\n<th style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">CON</th>\n<th style=\"width:17.0088%;height:17px\">INT</th>\n<th style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">WIS</th>\n<th style=\"width:14.0762%;height:17px\">CHA</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:17.0088%;height:17px\">22 (+6)</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">12 (+1)</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">14 (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.0088%;height:17px\">12 (+1)</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.3021%;height:17px\">16 (+3)</td>\n<td style=\"width:14.0762%;height:17px\">8 (-1)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Assocation Proficiencies<br />Strength +18, Dexterity +7, Constitution +8, Wisdom +15,</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<section id=\"-mandalorians-goals\">\n<h3 id=\"-mandalorians-goals\">GOALS</h3>\n<p>Mandalorian culture places heavy emphasis on strength and worthiness.

{"name":"The Darksaber","content":"<p><em>\"Anyone can hold the Darksaber. The trick is keeping it, along with your head.\"</em><br />―Ursa Wren to Sabine Wren</p>\n<p>The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, prior to 1019 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.</p>\n<p>The Darksaber was an ancient black-bladed lightsaber. It had a unique blade that was shorter than that of most lightsabers, and shaped like a traditional sword. Its overall profile was distinctly Mandalorian with an angular pommel, hand guard, and slit-shaped blade emitter. The sound emitted by its blade was also higher pitched than other lightsabers.</p>\n<p>The Darksaber had a crystal which served as a conduit for Force energy. The wielder's thoughts and actions guided the blade's current of power, with the blade often producing an electrical effect in response to a heightened emotional state. The Darksaber was also capable of parrying lightsaber blades, with them being drawn to each other in an almost magnetic pull. It was respected by the Mandalorians as a symbol for the leadership of House Vizsla, and later Death Watch.</p>\n<p>According to Mandalorian custom, one could only obtain the Darksaber by defeating the previous owner in combat. Should they have claimed it any other way, their claim was considered illegitimate.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"l4V5sWdK1q3eXkPg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.gn06PXjOKkzXgSs1"}},"_id":"ki4qe0BhcGZjADQw"}

Known as beskar'gam in the Mandalorian language of Mando'a—a name which meant \"iron skin\" when translated into Basic—Mandalorian armor was central to the Mandalorian way of life. The wearing of armor was one of the Resol'nare, the six tenets that defined the Mandalorian culture.
